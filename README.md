# Fredrik&apos;s Auran-related Development Repository

This repository contains my personal development for Auran-related Products. Currently, this is just contains development related to the Trainz Simulator series.

## Trainz Simulator

The main part of this repository constitutes my development of tools and contents for Auran's and N3V Games Trainz Simulator series.

### Asset Development

Please go to the [`assets`](./assets) subfolder to have a look at the Trainz Assets I am publishing or currently developing. The README in that folder will go more into depth about my Asset Development efforts.

## Reference Source

In the [`auran-ref`](https://github.com/couven92/auran/tree/auran-ref) branch of this repository, I have placed Auran reference source for development convenience.

**NOTE:** All code within the [`auran-ref`](https://github.com/couven92/auran/tree/auran-ref) branch is not owned by me, and all files within that branch are exempted from this repository [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) specification as I am not authorised to issue a license for these.

The reason for having the reference source in this repository in the first place is simple convenience. I sometimes develop Trainz Assets on a computer that does not have a copy of Trainz Simulator installed. By including the reference source in this repository I can lookup Trainz library functions without having to install the product.
