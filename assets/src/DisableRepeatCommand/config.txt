description						"Driver Schedule Command used to disable repetition of Driver Commands in the schedule of a Driver Character.
This Command mirrors the Enable Repeat Command (KUID2:192081:2:4).
Disabling Repetition is useful when you want parts of the commands in your schedule to be repeated at the end of execution, but do not want to enter a looping schedule.
Disabling Repetition also comes in handy when creating complex schedules with conditional branching and inner loops.
