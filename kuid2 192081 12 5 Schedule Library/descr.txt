ScheduleLibrary:
Create your library of driver command schedules and use them with the CopyCommandFrom rule. This allows modular command design.

CopyCommandsFrom:
Append or insert the driver commands from another driver or (much better) from the ScheduleLibrary rule.

EnableRepeat:
Enables the driver command repeat option and is best used together with the CopyCommandsFrom rule and required in the ScheduleLibrary rule.
