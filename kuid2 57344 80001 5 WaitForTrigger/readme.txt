Description:
A Driver Command that allows you to tell a driver to wait until
a Trigger is triggered by a train.

Manual:
To use this command you need to add it in your sessions Driver Command Setup Rule.

Right Click on the Driver itself or the Loco with the Driver, and select Wait For Trigger.
The next Step is to choose which trigger you want to wait for, and then which train should
trigger the Trigger you selected. You can also select Any Train, so the first train that
triggers the Trigger fullfills the command.

The Trains are identified by their leading locomotive. In the menu you will only see Trains that have
a locomotive. If a consist that has no locomotive comes across the selected Trigger nothing will 
happen too.

Please be carefull that you do not give two Triggers the same name. You will see them 
both in the Menu, but just one of them will work (trigger), and you would have to try
which one, and it might not allways be the same. So better make sure every trigger has an
unique name.
